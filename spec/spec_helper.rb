  # The settings below are suggested to provide a good initial experience

  #   # This allows you to limit a spec run to individual examples or groups
  #   # you care about by tagging them with `:focus` metadata. When nothing
  #   # is tagged with `:focus`, all examples get run. RSpec also provides
  #   # aliases for `it`, `describe`, and `context` that include `:focus`
  #   # metadata: `fit`, `fdescribe` and `fcontext`, respectively.
  #   config.filter_run_when_matching :focus
  #
  #   # Allows RSpec to persist some state between runs in order to support
  #   # the `--only-failures` and `--next-failure` CLI options. We recommend
  #   # you configure your source control system to ignore this file.
  #   config.example_status_persistence_file_path = "spec/examples.txt"

  #   # Limits the available syntax to the non-monkey patched syntax that is
  #   # recommended. For more details, see:
